        <h1 ><u>Electricity Billing System</u></h1>
        <p>I am proud to present my work on a robust desktop application that emulates
             a real-world Electricity Billing System. Leveraging <b>Java</b>, specifically Java's 
             JFrame and AWT frameworks, and seamlessly integrating with <b>MySQL</b> for database
              operations, I have developed an application that caters to the complexities of
             electricity billing.<br>
             <h2>Significance</h2>
             This Electricity Billing System closely resembles real-world scenarios, 
             providing practical solutions for managing and automating the complexities
              of electricity billing. The application streamlines processes for administrators
               and enhances the experience for end-users.
               <h2>Future Goals</h2>
               In my ongoing journey as a developer, I aspire to continually enhance
                and expand my skill set. I am eager to explore new technologies and 
                innovative approaches that can further improve user experiences and 
                address real-world challenges in the field of software development.
